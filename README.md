### Purpose
Walk other students through the process of solving a practice FRQ.


### Example Product

### Instructions
__Part 1: Understand and solve the problem__
- Read over the provided FRQ prompt and ask questions to be sure you fully understand the problem.
- Choose the one method for which you will be recording a walkthrough.
- Solve the method yourself on paper.
- Grade yourself with the provided rubric, compare your solution to the sample solution, and make updates to your solution so that it earns all the available points.
- Validate your solution with a partner or teacher to be sure it's correct.

__Part 2: Get to know your screen recording software__
- Install chrome extension called screencastify and sign in with your school google account. (You may use a different screen recording software if you like).
- Spend a little time making short test videos in screencastify to get a feel for how it works.
- Be sure you know how to start and stop a recording session.
- Be sure audio is captured.
- Try embedding the webcam view.

__Part 3: Prepare and record your walkthrough__
-Narrate (audio) while live coding or while showing a premade google slideshow.
Max video length = 5 minutes.
This does not need to be polished.
Share to this google classroom assignment (screencastify will give you this option at the end).
We'll watch each other's videos at the start of next class.

### Anchor Standard
Anchor Standard 5: Communicating

_Communication involves personal expression and exchanging ideas with others. In computer science, students communicate with diverse audiences about the use and effects of computation and the appropriateness of computational choices. Students write clear comments, document their work, and __communicate their ideas through multiple forms of media. Clear communication includes using precise language and carefully considering possible audiences__._
