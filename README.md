# DIY walkthrough

### Purpose
Walk other students through the process of solving a practice FRQ.


### Instructions
Task: Make a walkthrough vid
You choose which method, either moveUp or newFirstRow.
Install chrome extension called screencastify and sign in with your school google account.
(You may use a different screen recording software if you like).
Spend a little time messing around with screencastify to get a feel for how it works.
Narrate (audio) while live coding or while showing a premade google slideshow.
Max video length = 5 minutes.
This does not need to be polished.
Share to this google classroom assignment (screencastify will give you this option at the end).
We'll watch each other's videos at the start of next class.
Example video linked below for a different FRQ.


### Anchor Standard
Anchor Standard 5: Communicating

_Communication involves personal expression and exchanging ideas with others. In computer science, students communicate with diverse audiences about the use and effects of computation and the appropriateness of computational choices. Students write clear comments, document their work, and __communicate their ideas through multiple forms of media. Clear communication includes using precise language and carefully considering possible audiences__._
